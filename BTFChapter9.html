                correct: [1],
                explanation: "Agency theory addresses the conflict that arises when control of a company (by managers/directors) is separate from ownership (by shareholders). Managers act as 'agents' for shareholders, but their interests may not always align.",

                explanation: "In bank-based systems, banks are the dominant force in external finance.
